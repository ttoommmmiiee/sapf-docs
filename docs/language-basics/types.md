# Types

> "It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure than 10 functions on 10 data structures." 
> Alan Perlis

The language has a bare minimum of data types:
- **Real** - a 64 bit double precision floating point number for quantifying things.
- **String** - a string of characters for naming things.
- **List** - Ordered lists of values that function as both arrays and lazy potentially infinitely long sequences.
- **Form** - An object that maps symbolic names to values. A form is a dictionary with inheritance.
- **Function** - Functions are values that when applied take values from the stack and evaluate an expression.
- **Ref** - A mutable container for a value. This is the only mutable data type.
